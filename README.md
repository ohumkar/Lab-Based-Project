    - Use mean or mice imputation
- Data is highly imbalanced
    - We hardly have any information of products that went on backorder

### Questions to answers using EDA

- Most popular products (top - 10)

- Which of these products faced backorders ?
- Of the products that went on backorder what was the cause ? 
    - Amt of stock orders overdue
    - Risk flags
    - Current stock for them
